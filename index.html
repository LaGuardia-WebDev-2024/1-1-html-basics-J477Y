<h1>creep by radiohead<h1>
  <h2>lyrics<h2>
    </p>When you were here before</p>
 </p>Couldn't look you in the eye </p>
 </p>You're just like an angel </p>
 </p>Your skin makes me cry </p>
You float like a feather </p>
In a beautiful world </p>
I wish I was special </p>
You're so fuckin' special </p>

[Chorus] </p>
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo </p>
What the hell am I doin' here? </p>
I don't belong here </p>

[Verse 2] </p>
I don't care if it hurts </p>
I wanna have control </p>
I want a perfect body </p>
I want a perfect soul </p>
I want you to notice </p>
When I'm not around </p>
You're so fuckin' special </p>
I wish I was special </p>

[Chorus] </p>
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo </p>
What the hell am I doin' here? </p>
I don't belong here </p>
Oh-oh, oh-oh </p>
    </p>
